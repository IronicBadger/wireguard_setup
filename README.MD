# WireGuard Setup

This script is made for simplifying the set up of a wireguard vpn as well as an unbound DNS server.
It's originally designed for a Debian server, but could be improved for other Os.

## Usage

Make sure you have WireGuard installed on your server. Follow [those instructions](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) from the official WireGuard website.

```
./server_config.sh <command>
```
